This recognizer is from "Opencv for secret agents" chapter 3.The book version uses wxPython with python 2.7
I tweaked it to use tkinter instand of wxPython because i tried and failed miserably to build wxPython. :(

This version is using python 3.5.

Help on how to use tkinter video was taken from => https://solarianprogrammer.com/2018/04/21/python-opencv-show-video-tkinter-window/


to run the program => python app.py
